  {q:"What is a pip?", a:"The smallest standard price movement. Most pairs: 0.0001 (4th decimal). JPY pairs: 0.01 (2nd decimal). Pipette = 0.00001 (5th decimal)."},
  {q:"What is leverage?", a:"Borrowing from your broker to control a larger position. 100:1 = $1,000 controls $100,000. Amplifies both profits AND losses equally."},
  {q:"What is the Bid price?", a:"The price at which you can SELL. Always lower than the Ask. The market maker buys from you at this price."},
  {q:"What is the Ask price?", a:"The price at which you can BUY. Always higher than the Bid. The market maker sells to you at this price."},
  {q:"What is the Spread?", a:"Difference between Bid and Ask — the broker's built-in fee. EUR/USD: normally 0.5-2 pips. Exotic pairs: 10-50+ pips. Widens dramatically during news."},
  {q:"What is a Standard Lot?", a:"100,000 currency units. On EUR/USD with USD account = ~$10 per pip movement. Too large for most beginners."},
  {q:"What is a Mini Lot?", a:"10,000 units. ~$1 per pip on EUR/USD. Good for accounts with $1,000-$5,000 balance."},
  {q:"What is a Micro Lot?", a:"1,000 units. ~$0.10 per pip on EUR/USD. Best for beginners and small accounts under $1,000."},

  {q:"What is a Margin Call?", a:"Broker warning when your equity falls below required margin level (~100%). Must deposit more funds or close trades or broker auto-closes positions."},
  {q:"What is a Stop Loss?", a:"Auto-closes trade at predetermined loss level. Non-negotiable — ALWAYS use one. Place at logical S&R level, not random pips. Never move it further away."},

  {q:"What is Resistance?", a:"Price level where selling overcomes buying — price bounces down. More tests = stronger level. Broken resistance becomes support (role reversal)."},
  {q:"What is Role Reversal?", a:"When broken support becomes resistance, or broken resistance becomes support. Trading the retest of a broken level is one of the highest-probability setups."},
  {q:"What is the 1% Rule?", a:"Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on any single trade. Allows surviving 50+ consecutive losses. The single most important rule in trading."},
  {q:"What is Risk/Reward Ratio?", a:"Relationship between potential loss and potential gain. 1:2 R:R = risk $1 to make $2. Minimum recommended: 1:2. With 1:2 R:R, you only need 34% win rate to profit."},

  {q:"What is a Double Top?", a:"Two nearly equal highs at resistance. Enter SHORT on close below the neckline (middle low). Target = pattern height. Signals bullish exhaustion."},
